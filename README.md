#Movie Lovers

##Web Application based on Sinatra Ruby Framework.

A simple quiz game where a certain number of posters are displayed sharing a common word in their titles. At the beginnig you we'll be able to choose the difficulty level which is related to the number of posters to be shown.

The quiz consist in guessing which film was released in a certain year. A javascript alert message will be show saying if the answer was correct or not. If correct you'll be redirected to the next level.

Mini_magick rubygem required for cropping the poster images and ensure all of them will have the same size.

Be aware of folders ./public/img are missing in the repository due to both are initially empty.

Again, don't pay attention to the front-end desing, just to the core of the App ;)
